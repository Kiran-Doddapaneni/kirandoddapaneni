1.Vision Statement:
Our project aims to develop an AI-driven SIEM platform that combines real-time security monitoring with intelligent incident investigation and visualization. 
The system uses Wazuh for log collection and threat detection while integrating a custom AI investigation agent to analyze alerts, group related events into incidents, assign risk levels, and visualize attack relationships in an OpenCTI-inspired dashboard.
The platform is designed to help SOC analysts, security engineers, and cybersecurity learners better understand and respond to security threats through automation and clear visual insights.

3.User Stories:
1.SOC Analyst
  As a SOC analyst, I want alerts grouped into incidents so that I can investigate threats faster.
  As a SOC analyst, I want risk scores assigned to incidents so that I can prioritize critical attacks.
2.Security Engineer
  As a security engineer, I want customizable detection rules so that I can reduce false positives.
  As a security engineer, I want modular system components so that I can integrate additional tools later.
3.Cybersecurity Student
  As a student, I want attack relationships visualized so that I can understand attack patterns clearly.
  As a student, I want AI-generated explanations so that I can learn why alerts are triggered.
